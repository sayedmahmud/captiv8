 2. Flash (and beep) does not work
  o could we reverse highlight the ssid instead?
 3. add arrow key (left, right) support to configure->SSID
 4. In configure, would like to strikethrough dev name if it cannot be used
  tried overwriting with '-' but the background covers it up
 6. configure is a hodgepodge of coordinate systems, relative and absolute but
  it seems to be the only way to get it to work
 7. have set the execution loop in configure to catch cursess errors on curses.getmouse
  due to occasional "getmouse() returned err". don't know what this is from.
  For now, I catch and continue but this may end up be some unrecoverable error
  and this solution will cause the app to hang.
 8. in configure do we leave the return as is on Set even if nothing was changed?
   o this could be used to delete/reset config
   o but is user friendly?
 9. checking x length on radio options is pointless
11. Add a info button for chip hw, i.e. driver, chipset, manufacturer and
 other stuff?
12. Handle shrink/grow
  o when shrunk beyond 80x24 and then "regrown", screen does not regenerate/redraw
14. add a clear btn on configure
18. the color scheme for state symbol is hard to see (may have to do all green)
 or green for connected, white for everything else
