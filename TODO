 2. Flash (and beep) does not work
  o could we reverse highlight the ssid instead?
 3. add arrow key (left, right) support to configure->SSID
 4. In configure, would like to strikethrough dev name if it cannot be used
  tried overwriting with '-' but the background covers it up
 6. configure is a hodgepodge of coordinate systems, relative and absolute but
  it seems to be the only way to get it to work
 7. have set the execution loop in configure to catch cursess errors on curses.getmouse
  due to occasional "getmouse() returned err". don't know what this is from.
  For now, I catch and continue but this may end up be some unrecoverable error
  and this solution will cause the app to hang.
 8. in configure do we leave the return as is on Set even if nothing was changed?
   o this could be used to delete/reset config
   o but is user friendly?
 9. checking x length on radio options is pointless
10. check for supports color
